# meeting-manager
A "Trade Floor" application that can receive PSTN calls (Webex Connect) with custom IVR, and direct the caller to a WxMeeting (by way of WxCalling).  Can also receive SIP calls from devices using a static dial string and direct them to the WxMeeting as well.


<!--- Subtitle of your README file
This should match the description of the project as it is but is formatted as **bold**.
-->

<!--- Formatting your README file
Use consistent header and spacing. The title must use 1st level heading (ie. #).
All subsequent sections must use 2nd level heading (ie. ##) and so on.
Avoid HTML tags as far as possible.
Use tables when necessary (see https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables).

# Git Template Extended Details and Explanations
**A template for creating Git repositories.**

Add a paragraph (multiple sentences) stating **WHAT** the project is about, **WHY** it exists and **WHO** it is for.  
Imagine explaining the project to someone without much technical background as a developer or Webex user.
As a result, you should avoid being too technical or verbose in the summary.  
Optionally, feel free to include an [image/gif](https://ezgif.com) file and link it to the YouTube demo
(if it exists) for your project.

## Overview

This is the section where you can go into the detail of the implementation.   
Focus on explaining **HOW** the implementation works. You need not give end-to-end details but an overview.


## Setup

Dedicate the opening portion of this section to state any pre-requisites that the user should satisfy before following
through the rest of the section. Also state any assumptions that you may have made about the user.

You are encouraged to use subsections and/or bullet points to outline each step.
However, caution against adding too many nested structures e.g. list inside a list inside another list.


## Demo

Link to the website (if deployed) and/or to the YouTube/Vidcast video.


## License
